Themeing MarketPress
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two methods to create custom designs for MarketPress stores:

Basic Styles:

  Basic styles are comprised of a css file and an optional images folder that is loaded
  and applied on store pages. To create a basic style:
  
  1. Create a css file in the /wp-content/marketpress-styles/ directory with your custom styles. It
      may be easiest to copy our default.css theme and modify it.
  2. Make sure to add the custom theme header with your theme's name at the top of the css file:
      /*
      MarketPress Style: CUSTOMNAME
      */
      Including this header will cause your custom theme to show in the dropdown on the
      Store Settings -> Presentation page so it may be selected.
  3. You can also optionally create a subdirectory for your css images in the /wp-content/marketpress-styles/ folder and
      link to images within it with relative urls like "image-folder/my-image.jpg".
      

Advanced Themes:

  MarketPress uses custom post types to display it's products. This means that you can use
  the same WP theme templating system you are familiar with. We simply provide a customized
  subset of template functions so you don't have to worry about dealing with post meta. Template
  functions are fully documented and can be found in the /marketpress/marketpress-includes/template-functions.php file. 

  
  E.g. to create a custom product page:

  1. Make a copy of the page.php template file in your theme directory and rename it mp_product.php

  2. mp_product.php must use the mp_* functions instead of the_content(), see template-functions.php for a list of functions relevant to products.


  MarketPress searches your current theme folder for template files specific to store pages. If
  a template file does not exist it loads the theme's page template instead. Just like WP, the
  plugin will search for templates in order of priority from top to bottom. Here are possible
  file names for store templates in order:
  
  Single Product Page
    mp_product-PRODUCTNAME.php
    mp_product-PRODUCTID.php
    mp_product.php
    
  Store Page
    mp_store.php
    
  Cart/Checkout Page
    mp_cart.php
    
  Order Status Page
    mp_orderstatus.php
    
  Product List Page
    mp_productlist.php
    
  Product Category List Page
    mp_category-CATEGORYSLUG.php
    mp_category-CATEGORYID.php
    mp_category.php
    mp_taxonomy.php
    mp_productlist.php
    
  Product Tag List Page
    mp_tag-TAGSLUG.php
    mp_tag-TAGID.php
    mp_tag.php
    mp_taxonomy.php
    mp_productlist.php
